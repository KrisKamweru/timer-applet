# Focus Timer App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.

## TL;DR

This small applet was created simply to pass some time, and to serve as a distraction from the main product I'm working on. It was inspired by a productivity tracker I was using that had some features locked behind a pro paywall. Why pay for what I can build myself, after all?

It will eventually catch up in functionality to the [app that inspired it](https://pomofocus.io/), and maybe even surpass it, should I have the time. The timing technique informing and inspiring development is the pomodoro technique, which you can find out more about [here](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique).


## Things to do

- [ ] Implement pomodoro specific timings
- [ ] Add hosting
- [ ] Add auditory and visual cues
- [ ] Improve syling
